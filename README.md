# FaceID
Face verification model training with tensor flow (only trained for one user at a time).

I had set up two scripts to take the training/testing photos and to organize some local files and folders, but my file system became corrupted, and I had to format my computer. Since those scripts were only auxiliary and not essential, I didn't bother to rewrite them.
